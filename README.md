# 🎵 Music Genre Classification

This project classifies music tracks into genres using machine learning techniques. It uses the GTZAN dataset and extracts meaningful audio features to train classifiers like SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and Neural Networks.

## 📁 Dataset

We use the [GTZAN dataset](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html), which contains:
- 1000 audio tracks (30 seconds each)
- 10 genres: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Rock

## 🎧 Feature Extraction

Using the `librosa` library, we extract:
- **MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**
- **Chroma Frequencies**
- **Spectral Contrast**
- **Tonnetz**

These features capture timbre, harmony, and rhythmic properties of audio.

## 🧠 Models Used

We experiment with multiple models:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks

Model performance is evaluated using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn librosa scikit-learn

git clone https://github.com/Saumi18/Music-Genre-Classification.git
cd Music-Genre-Classification

jupyter notebook Music_Genre_Classification.ipynb
```
Run all cells step-by-step to see feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

##📊 Output
